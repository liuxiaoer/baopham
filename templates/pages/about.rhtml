    <h2>Welcome to My Person Website</h2><img src="/images/newbao.jpg" alt="guess which one is me?" width="30%" height="30%" class="right" />
    <p>Hi! I'm Bao, a 3rd year Math and Computer Science student at <a href='http://ubc.ca/' target="_blank">UBC</a>. Why I chose that major? Math has always come natural to me and I love working on the computer and being able to create things in its own languages. I created this website as a place for me to explore new technologies, practice my skills and blog on things that I find interesting.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in web development, algorithms, low-level concepts and machine learning (not much experience but that's one of my goals to achieve in the future). Besides that, I also enjoy poetry, literature and music (I have a musical background in piano)...Now guess which one is me in the picture?</p>
