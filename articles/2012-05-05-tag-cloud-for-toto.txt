description: Tag Cloud for Toto

As I mentioned in the [previous post]("/2012/03/21/abandoning-appengine/") about [toto]("http://cloudhead.io/toto") blog engine, and how I have made some customizations, I still felt like something was missing.

Okay, I have sitemap, pagination, mobile redirect, tags... what else could be missing that would appear in most blog websites? 

**tag cloud** of course!! Duh...

<small>*Just joking...*</small>

Anyway, so I went back and fired an issue on the [karakuri]("https://github.com/5v3n/karakuri") rack plugin github to see if this feature is possible to implement. Long story short, I made a pull request and with the support of the [author]("https://github.com/5v3n"), now you can have the tag cloud feature. Isn't it sweet?

<blockquote>

    <p><strong>Tag Cloud</strong></p>

    <p>Example usage:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Tags&lt;/h1&gt;
<%  Karakuri::tag_cloud(@articles).each do |tag, freq| %>
    <%= %|<a href="/tagged?tag=#{tag}" alt="articles concerning #{tag}" style="font-size: #{10 * freq}px">#{tag}</a>| %>
<% end %></pre>
</blockquote>
