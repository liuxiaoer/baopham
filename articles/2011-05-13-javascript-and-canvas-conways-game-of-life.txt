description: Conway's Game of Life animation with JavasScript and Canvas

<p>Being inspired by my school project from CS111 <b>Introduction to Computation</b>, I implemented the game again in JavaScript and used HTML5 canvas to display the cells and animation (HTML5 browser support is required).~~~</p>

<p><i>From wikipedia</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" target="_blank">cellular automaton</a> devised by the British mathematician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway" target="_blank">John Horton Conway</a> in 1970.</p>
    <strong>Rules:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.&#8221;</li>
    </ol>
