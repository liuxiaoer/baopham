<p>I've recently started to participate in this site <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. It's a website with a series of mathematics/programming problems, ranging from easy to very hard. Some problems, if not solved using the right algorithm, can take more than 5 minutes to get the result (personal experience, I forgot that it was running...). So it only matters if you use correct and efficient algorithms. These problems are meant to be solved in only less than a minute.</p>
<p>Now I'm quite addicted to the thrilling feeling of getting the right answer :D. There are certainly numerous solutions out there on the web (and I admit, sometimes I have to resort to them when I'm stuck), but it's always more exciting to try and learn new algorithms and apply them to the problems.</p>
<p>Check out my Git repository of my solutions (mostly in Python because I find it faster and neater to code, no?) to some of the Euler questions: <a href="https://github.com/baopham/projectEuler">baopham/projectEuler</a></p>
